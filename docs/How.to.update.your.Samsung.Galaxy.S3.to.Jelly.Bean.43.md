The firmware version I9300XXLEF is an official release from Samsung for the Galaxy S3 model GT-I9300. It was released in June 2012 and it is based on Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich. It is available for some regions, such as Taiwan[^1^].
 
However, if you want to enjoy the new features and improvements of Jelly Bean 4.3, such as Google Now, improved notifications, lock screen widgets, multi-user support, and more, you will need to update your firmware to a newer version.
 
There are two ways to update your firmware: using Samsung Kies or using Odin. Samsung Kies is a software that allows you to connect your phone to your computer and check for updates. Odin is a tool that allows you to flash custom ROMs and kernels on your phone.
 
Before you proceed with any of these methods, make sure you backup your data, charge your battery, and enable USB debugging on your phone. Also, be aware that updating your firmware may void your warranty and may cause some issues with your phone.
 
## Using Samsung Kies
 
This is the easiest and safest way to update your firmware, as it will automatically download and install the official update from Samsung. However, this method may not work for all regions or carriers, so you may need to wait for the update to be available for your device.
 
To use Samsung Kies, follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install Samsung Kies on your computer from [here](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/kies).
2. Launch Samsung Kies and connect your phone to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Wait for Samsung Kies to recognize your phone and check for updates.
4. If there is an update available, click on the Update button and follow the instructions on the screen.
5. Do not disconnect your phone or turn off your computer until the update is complete.
6. When the update is done, disconnect your phone and reboot it.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated your firmware to Jelly Bean 4.3 using Samsung Kies.
 
## Using Odin
 
This is a more advanced and risky way to update your firmware, as it will require you to download and flash a custom ROM on your phone. This method may work for any region or carrier, but it may also cause some problems with your phone, such as losing some features or functionality.
 
To use Odin, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Odin on your computer from [here](https://odindownload.com/).
2. Download a custom ROM based on Jelly Bean 4.3 for your Galaxy S3 from [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/f/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-i9300-i9305-roms-kernels-recoveries-other-development.1649/). Make sure you choose a ROM that is compatible with your device model and region.
3. Extract the downloaded ROM file on your computer and you will get a file with .tar or .tar.md5 extension.
4. Turn off your phone and boot it into download mode by pressing and holding Volume Down + Home + Power buttons together.
5. Launch Odin on your computer and connect your phone to your computer using a USB cable.
6. Wait for Odin to recognize your phone and show a blue or yellow box in the ID:COM section.
7. Click on the PDA or AP button in Odin and browse for the ROM file that you extracted earlier.
8. Make sure that only Auto Reboot and F. Reset Time options are checked in Odin and nothing else.
9. Click on the Start button in Odin and wait 0f148eb4a0
