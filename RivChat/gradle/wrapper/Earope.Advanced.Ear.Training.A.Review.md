In this article, we will review the main features, benefits and drawbacks of Earope Advanced Ear Training v1.65-AiR full version[^1^] [^2^], which was released in 2006 by Cope Media. We will also compare it with some alternative ear training software programs that are available today.
 
## Features of Earope Advanced Ear Training
 
Earope Advanced Ear Training has a simple and intuitive user interface that allows the user to choose from different categories of exercises, such as intervals, scales, chords, melody, rhythm and chord progressions. Each category has several subcategories and options to customize the difficulty level, range, tempo, instrument sound and playback mode. The user can also create their own exercises by selecting the notes or chords they want to practice.
 
One of the unique features of Earope is the EarTutorial mode, which acts as a personal tutor for the user. It automatically adjusts the level of difficulty based on the user's performance and errors. It also gives hints and explanations for each problem and tracks the user's progress and statistics. The user can also review their previous sessions and see their strengths and weaknesses.
 
Another feature of Earope is the option to use a MIDI keyboard or a computer keyboard to input the answers. This can help the user to develop their sight-reading and keyboard skills as well as their ear skills. The user can also record their own voice or instrument and use it as a sound source for the exercises.

## Drawbacks of Earope Advanced Ear Training
 
Despite its many advantages, Earope Advanced Ear Training also has some drawbacks that should be considered before buying it. Some of these are:

- The software is outdated and may not be compatible with newer operating systems or devices. The latest version was released in 2006 and there is no indication that it will be updated or supported in the future.
- The software is not free and may be hard to find online. The official website of Cope Media is no longer active and the software is not available on any major online platforms. The only way to get it is through third-party websites or sources that may not be reliable or secure[^3^] [^4^] [^5^].
- The software may not have enough variety or depth for some users. The exercises are mostly based on standard musical elements and do not cover more advanced topics such as modes, polyrhythms, microtones or jazz harmony. The sound quality and graphics are also basic and may not appeal to some users.
